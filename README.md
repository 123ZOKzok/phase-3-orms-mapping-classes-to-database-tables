# orm-mapping-to-tabel


Start with a simple domain. The goal should be to realize the direct mapping between Artist (lets say) and the artists table. Assume you already have the artists table. Create attributes (manually, no meta stuff) that match each of the columns. Then write the Artist.all method (SELECT) that returns and Artist object. No Meta! Then write a find_by_name method
